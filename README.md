Alice Development Kit
---------------------

This is a development kit to be used alongside Alice. 

The Devkit consists of an embedded web server that provides a clean interface to 
all available Entities and Stringtables.
In addition some basic game information is included such as heroes picked, current
in-game time and the number of messages parsed.
